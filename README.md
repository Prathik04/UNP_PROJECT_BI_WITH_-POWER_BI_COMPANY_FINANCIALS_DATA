# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_COMPANY_FINANCIALS_DATA

Developed in collaboration with UNP, this Power BI dashboard offers a thorough analysis of an organization's financial performance. It monitors key metrics like total sales, gross and net profit, and revenue trends while also tracking cost management across various segments. The dashboard highlights the most profitable products, evaluates the impact of discounts on sales, and uncovers opportunities for cost optimization. It provides insights into year-over-year growth, profit margins, and financial health indicators, all of which empower data-driven decision-making and enhance financial strategies. With a user-friendly interface, the dashboard visually represents critical financial metrics, making it easy for stakeholders at all levels to identify. This fosters a data-driven culture within the organization and supports informed strategic decisions.
